AIRPORTS

Airline ID 	Unique OpenFlights identifier for this airline.
Name 	Name of the airline.
Alias 	Alias of the airline. For example, All Nippon Airways is commonly known as "ANA".
IATA 	2-letter IATA code, if available.
ICAO 	3-letter ICAO code, if available.
Callsign 	Airline callsign.
Country 	Country or territory where airline is incorporated.
Active 	"Y" if the airline is or has until recently been operational, "N" if it is defunct. This field is not reliable: in particular, major airlines that stopped flying long ago, but have not had their IATA code reassigned (eg. Ansett/AN), will incorrectly show as "Y".

The data is ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) encoded. The special value \N is used for "NULL" to indicate that no value is available, and is understood automatically by MySQL if imported.
